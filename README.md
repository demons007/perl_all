Perl programs

http://padre.perlide.org/
Padre is a Perl IDE, an integrated development environment, or in other words a text editor that is simple to use for new Perl programmers but also supports large multi-lingual and multi-technology projects.

Our primary focus is to create a peerless environment for learning Perl and creating Perl scripts, modules and distributions, with an extensible plug-in system to support the addition of related functionality and languages and to support advanced developers taking the editor anywhere they want it to go.
